            <p>Welcome to my wonderful website. If you are new here, please take a look around. You might just <a id="hiddenLink">find</a> something interesting about me.
            </p>

            <p id="easterEgg"></p>

            <p>I work in coastal environmental restoriation at Pontchatrain Conservancy. There, I am the Coastal Data
            Sharing Program Developer and Technology Coordinator. Part of my job requires handling data requests as
            they come in and packaging different data sets (either the raw salinity data or interpolated salinity
            contours) for the end user. Folks who use the data are primarily other non profits, government agencies,
            and academic institutions. Sometimes we get requests from commercial and recreational fisher-folk who
            are trying to get a sense of the salinity and where the fish might be biting.</p>

            <p>Another aspect of my job is to assist different departments with their technology needs. This might mean
            updating a webpage (using wordpress, and maybe soon actual HTML/CSS and javascript in the near
            future!)vor the gift shop, creating maps for tree identification, or operating a drone for restoration
            monitoring.</p>

            <p>Recently, I've been helping the education department with a marine debris project, specifically the data
            collection, interpretation, and visualization. You can learn more about this project <a href="#" style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;">here</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class='container project'>
            <h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

            <p>Before learing HTML/CSS and Javascript, I had been teaching myself Python. It is a useful language for
            data analysis and for writing scripts to automate tedious tasks. Recently, I wrote a script that bulk
            imports salinty shapefiles into ArcGis Pro and uploads it to an online server, with the idea that people
            that need that data can go online and fetch it themselves, without having a dedicated person to handle
            the data requests. That project is <a href="#" style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;">here</a>
            if you want to see how I did it.</p>

            <p>I'm also currently the only FAA licensed drone pilot at the organization. Besides looking very
            interesting, drone footage is useful for community and public outreach. Below is an example of a planting site around the Manch ac landbridge near Ruddock, LA. <br> <video src="media/Galva_canal.mp4" type="video/mp4" width="100%" controls preload autoplay></video></p>

            <h3 id="wrapUp">Wrapping Up</h3>

            <p>I've gained a lot from this project and I'm excited to continue the process of learning in levels 2 and 3
                and beyond. This site is by no means complete, and I will continue to add content to the site. </p>

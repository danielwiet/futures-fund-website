            <p>I started my coding journey online with Codecademy, Datacamp, freeCodeCamp, and Grasshopper just to name a few. The idea was to dabble with coding to see what I would be interested in, and figure out what platform worked best for my learning style. Long story short, I forgot to cancel my free membership with Codecademy so I ended up with a year subscription</p>

            <p>I've focused mostly with Python and wrote some scripts to automate uploading GIS shapefiles to an publish online at my last job. The code is at my <a href="https://github.com/danielwiet/arcgis-upload-to-online-server" style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Github repository here</a> if you are interested in checking it out.</p>

            <p>Recently, I started a new job with the Army Corps of Engineers in the New Orleans District as a Hydrologic Tech. At my job, I am a part of a team that manages and measures the water surface elevation which the engineers use for modeling. It involves maintaining water level gages on the Mississippi River and surrounding waterways. It's been really busy starting a new job, and I haven't put as much time into the bootcamp or coding as I would have liked for level 3. With that said, I'm proud of what I created and I think the site has potential.</p>

            <p>In the meantime, here is a picture of me driving a boat.</p>

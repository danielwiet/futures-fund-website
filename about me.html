            <p>I started my coding journey online with Codecademy, Datacamp, freeCodeCamp, and Grasshopper just to name a few. The idea was to dabble with coding to see what I would be interested in, and figure out what platform worked best for my learning style. Long story short, I forgot to cancel my free membership with Codecademy so I ended up with a year subscription</p>

            <p>I've focused mostly with Python and wrote some scripts to automate uploading GIS shapefiles to an publish online at my last job. The code is at my <a href="https://github.com/danielwiet/arcgis-upload-to-online-server" style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Github repository here</a> if you are interested in checking it out.</p>

            <p>Recently, I started a new job with the Army Corps of Engineers in the New Orleans District as a Hydrologic Tech. At my job, I am a part of a team that manages and measures the water surface elevation which the engineers use for modeling. It involves maintaining water level gages on the Mississippi River and surrounding waterways.</p>

            <p>The other thing I would have liked to included are links to my <a href="projects.html" style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">project page</a></p>

            <p>In the meantime, here is a picture of me driving a boat.</p>
